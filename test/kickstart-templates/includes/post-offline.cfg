# Follow "Configuring networking settings for fully disconnected hosts" manual
# pages to implement the needed settings. Note that the 'nmcli' commands cannot
# be used as they are overriden by the NetworkManager during the installation.
# Instead, the settings are added to an 'nmconnection' configuration file that
# persists after the installation is finished.

# See https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_build_of_microshift/4.17/html-single/networking/index#microshift-disconnected-host-network-config_microshift-networking-disconnected-hosts

# The configuration file contains the following settings:
# - Add a fake IP address to the loopback interface
# - Bypass the automatic DNS
# - Point the DNS interface to use the local name server
